          The figure shows the mixture of emergence and persistence filters in the left panel, where each model consists of two mixture components. By combining the different components from both models, we generate up to four possible persistence estimates for the feature's state, as depicted in the middle panel. Finally, based on the available measurements, Perpetua selects the combination that achieves the highest posterior weight, enabling it to accurately model the persistence of a semi-static feature, as shown in the right panel. This panel also visualizes the dynamic switching between the persistence and emergence models.
